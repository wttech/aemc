# Distributions

## CLI - Overview

Provides complete set of commands to comfortably work with CRX packages, OSGi configurations, repository nodes and more.

Key assumptions:

- Idempotent and fast
- Rich configuration options
- Self-describing, both machine & human-readable 
- Multiple input & output formats (text/yaml/json)

Main features:

- easy & declarative setup of:
  - JDK (isolated, version tied to project)
  - AEM instances (run modes, JVM & start opts, env & secret vars, Sling props, custom admin password)
  - OSGi (configurations, bundles, components)
  - replication agents 
  - any repository nodes
- deploying AEM packages with:
  - automatic workflow toggling - avoiding DAM asset renditions regeneration
  - advanced snapshot handling - avoiding redeploying the same package by checksum verification
  - customizable instance health checking
- building AEM packages with:
  - source code change detection - avoiding rebuilding application when it is not needed 
- making AEM instance backups (with restoring)
  - advanced archive format to speed up performance and storage efficiency ([ZSTD](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) used by default)
  - instance state aware - stopping, archiving then starting again AEM instances automatically (if needed)

Worth knowing:

- On Windows use it with [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) ([CMD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd) and [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) are not supported nor tested)

## CLI - AEM Project Quickstart

Run one of the commands below according to the AEM version you are using to initialize the AEM Compose tool in your project (e.g generated from [Adobe AEM Project Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype#usage)):

- Cloud/AEMaaCS/SDK/20xx.xx.xx

  ```shell
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wttech/aemc/main/project/cloud/init.sh | sh
  ```

- Classic/On-Prem/6.5.x

  ```shell
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wttech/aemc/main/project/classic/init.sh | sh
  ```

After successful initialization, remember to always use the tool via wrapper script in the following way:

```shell
sh aemw [command]
```

For example:

```shell
sh aemw version
```

## CLI - Building & installing from source

Ensure having installed [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) then run command:

- latest released version: `go install github.com/wttech/aemc/cmd/aem@latest`,
- specific released version: `go install github.com/wttech/aemc/cmd/aem@v0.16.3`,
- recently committed version: `go install github.com/wttech/aemc/cmd/aem@main`,

Use installed version of the tool instead of the one defined in file *aem/api.sh* by running the following command:

```shell
export AEM_CLI_VERSION=installed
```

To start using again version from wrapper file, simply unset the environment variable:

```shell
unset AEM_CLI_VERSION
```

## Ansible Collection

See a separate project based on AEM Compose: <https://github.com/wttech/aemc-ansible>

## Go Scripting

Consider implementing any application on top of AEM Compose API like using snippet below:

File: *aem.go*

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "os"
import aemc "github.com/wttech/aemc/pkg"

func main() {
    aem := aemc.NewAem()
    instance := aem.InstanceManager().NewLocalAuthor()
    changed, err := instance.PackageManager().DeployWithChanged("/tmp/my-package.zip")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("cannot deploy package: %s\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    if changed {
      aem.InstanceManager().AwaitStartedOne(instance)
    }
    fmt.Printf("package deployed properly\n")
    os.Exit(0)
}
```

Then to run application use command:

```shell
go run aem.go
```

# Dependencies

This tool is written in Go. Go applications are very often self-sufficient which means that they are not relying on platform-specific libraries/dependencies. 
The only requirement is to use proper tool binary distribution for each operating system and architecture.
Check out [releases page](https://github.com/wttech/aemc/releases) to review available binary distributions.

# Configuration

## Generating default configuration

To start working with tool run command:

```shell
aem config init
```

It will produce default configuration file named *aem.yml*. 
Correct the `dist_file`, `license_file`, `unpack_dir` properties to provide essential files to be able to launch AEM instances.

```yml
# AEM instances to work with
instance:

  # Defined by single value (only remote)
  config_url: ''

  # Defined strictly with full details (local or remote)
  config:
    local_author:
      http_url: http://127.0.0.1:4502
      user: admin

  full_timestamp: true

input:
  format: yml
  file: STDIN

output:
  format: text
  file: aem/home/aem.log
```

After instructing tool where the AEM instances files are located then, finally, instances may be created and launched:

```shell
aem instance create
aem instance start
```

## Configuration precedence

All configuration options specified in file *aem.yml* could be overridden by environment variables.
Simply add prefix `AEM_` then each level of nested YAML object join with `_` and lowercase the name of each object.

For example: `instance.local.quickstart.dist_file` could be overridden by environment variable `AEM_INSTANCE_LOCAL_QUICKSTART_DIST_FILE`

Also note that some configuration options may be ultimately overridden by CLI flags, like `--output-format`.

## Performance optimization

By default, fail-safe options are in use. However, to achieve maximum performance of the tool, considering setting these options:

```shell
export AEM_OUTPUT_MODE=none
export AEM_INSTANCE_PROCESSING_MODE=parallel
```

# Dev setup

## Prerequisites

1. Install Go: <https://go.dev/doc/install>,
2. Set up shell, append lines *~/.zshrc* with content below then restart IDE/terminals,

```shell
export GOPATH="$HOME/go"
export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
```

## Releasing

Simply run script:

```shell
sh release.sh <major.minor.patch>
```

It will:

* bump version is source files automatically,
* commit changes,
* push release tag that will initiate [release workflow](.github/workflows/release-perform.yml).
